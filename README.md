# Web Development Project 6 - Data Dashboard

Submitted by: Mariah Gonzales
This web app: allows users to view up to 100 different food items. They can search an item or filter through the items by selecting a food type. They can also view the total number of food items displayed based on their filter or search preferance (if any), as well as the range of sugar count in the items displayed, and the average protein count. There's also a pie chart that shows the total sugar and protein distribution across all of the results shown. When a food card is clicked, the user is taken to another link in the page that shows them all the nutrition facts of that particular item, including sugar, protein, calories, fat, saturated fat, sodium, fiber, and calcium.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Figuring out how to incorporate a graph was a little tricky as I never had any experience with creating one on a website. I also struggled with accessing information that I wanted to include into my food details link.
